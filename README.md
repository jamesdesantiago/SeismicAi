Leveraging real-time data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), this tool visualizes earthquake events, allowing users to explore patterns, magnitudes, and locations of seismic activities over selected time periods. The application aims to enhance awareness and understanding of seismic events, serving as a valuable resource for researchers, educators, emergency responders, and anyone interested in geoscience.
